## üöÄ Self-Hosting with Docker Compose (Production)
This is the recommended way to run Advanced ListDiff. It's simple, reliable, and will automatically restart the application if your server reboots.

### Prerequisites
You must have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your server.

### Step 1: Create a Directory
Create a dedicated directory on your server where you will store the configuration file.

```bash
mkdir listdiff-server
cd listdiff-server
```

### Step 2: Create `docker-compose.yml` File
Create a new file in this directory named `docker-compose.yml`.

```bash
touch docker-compose.yml
```

### Step 3: Paste the Configuration
Open the `docker-compose.yml` file and paste the following content.

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  advanced-listdiff:
    image: manimo/advanced-listdiff:latest
    
    # This maps the standard HTTP port (80) to the app's internal port.
    # To use a different port, change "80:9050" to "YOUR_PORT:9050".
    ports:
      - "8080:9050"
      
    # Ensures the app always restarts if it stops or the server reboots.
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Step 4: Start the Application
Run the following command from within the `listdiff-server` directory to start the application.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Your self-hosted instance of Advanced ListDiff is now running! You can access it at `http://your_server_ip:8080`.
